        <h2>What about Cheesecake?</h2>

        <p class="description">
          The first "cheese cake" may have been created on the Greek island of
          Samos. Physical anthropologists excavated cheese molds there which
          were dated circa 2,000 B.C. Cheese and cheese products had most likely
          been around for thousands of years before this, but earlier than this
          goes into prehistory (that period in human history before the
          invention of writing) so we will never really know. In Greece,
          cheesecake was considered to be a good source of energy, and there is
          evidence that it was served to athletes during the first Olympic games
          in 776 B.C. Greek brides and grooms were also known to use cheesecake
          as a wedding cake. The simple ingredients of flour, wheat, honey and
          cheese were formed into a cake and baked - a far cry from the more
          complicated recipes available today! The writer Athenaeus is credited
          for writing the first Greek cheesecake recipe in 230 A.D. (By this
          time, the Greeks had been serving cheesecake for over 2,000 years but
          this is the oldest known surviving Greek recipe!) It was also pretty
          basic - pound the cheese until it is smooth and pasty - mix the
          pounded cheese in a brass pan with honey and spring wheat flour - heat
          the cheese cake "in one mass" - allow to cool then serve. When the
          Romans conquered Greece, the cheesecake recipe was just one spoil of
          war. They modified it including crushed cheese and eggs. These
          ingredients were baked under a hot brick and it was served warm.
          Occasionally, the Romans would put the cheese filling in a pastry. The
          Romans called their cheese cake "libuma" and they served it on special
          occasions. Marcus Cato, a Roman politician in the first century B.C.,
          is credited as recording the oldest known Roman cheesecake recipe. As
          the Romans expanded their empire, they brought cheesecake recipes to
          the Europeans. Great Britain and Eastern Europe began experimenting
          with ways to put their own unique spin on cheesecake. In each country
          of Europe, the recipes started taking on different cultural shapes,
          using ingredients native to each region. In 1545, the first cookbook
          was printed.
