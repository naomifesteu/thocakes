        <h2>What about Cakes?</h2>

        <p>
          Cakes are served at special occasions (birthdays, weddings, holidays,
          funerals) because they represent our best culinary offering honoring
          our most loved people. In "olden times" when refined sugar, spices,
          nuts, and dried fruit were expensive, it was an honor to be honored
          with cake. Today cake isn't super expensive and we have many choices
          (store bought, box mix, scratch, bakery special order) but the message
          remains constant. Cake says: you're important and we love you.
