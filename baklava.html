        <h2>What about Baklava?</h2>

        <p class="description">
          The history of this scrumptious delicacy is quite controversial, and
          unfortunately not very well documented. Many ethnic groups such as the
          Greek, Turkish and Middle Easterners claim baklava as their own, and
          prepare it in their own ways. ancient-assyria The story of baklava
          began long long ago, as a matter of fact one version of the story
          claims that Baklava origins to the mighty Assyrians, who had been
          preparing it ancient-assyriaas early as the 8th century B.C. by
          layering unleavened flat bread with chopped nuts in between, drenching
          it in honey and then baking it in primitive wood-burning ovens. The
          modern day baklava went through a number of transitions as the history
          of the area kept on changing. Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean,
          Balkans, Caucasia; Turks, Arabs, Jews, Greeks, Armenians, Bulgarians
          of today who introduce baklava as their national dessert were all part
          of the Ottoman empire once. The modern day baklava went through a
