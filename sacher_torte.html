        <h2>What about Sacher Torte?</h2>

        <p class="description">
          <b>1832</b> - The Sachertorte was created by pastry chef Franz Sacher
          (1816-1907) in 1832 for Prince Clemens Lothar Wensel Metternich
          (1773-1859) of Austria, the Austrian State Chancellor. The prince
          enjoyed trying new dishes and ordered the chef to create a new cake.
          Orders were sent to the kitchens where it was instant pandemonium. The
          head chef was sick and the team of cooks in the kitchen had no idea
          what to prepare. Franz Sacher, a 16-year old apprentice cook, rolled
          up his sleeves and created this famous chocolate cake with the
          ingredients that were available. The Sacher Torte and other recipes
          made him prosperous, and he operated several cafes and restaurants.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>1876</b> - In 1876, Franz's son, Eduard Sacher, opened a grand
          hotel called the Hotel Sacher, but it was Eduard's dynamic,
          cigar-smoking wife, Anna, who turned it into one of Europe's greatest
          hostelries where the aristocracy and diplomats would meet. After
          Eduard's death his widow, Anna Sacher, became manager. Under her rule,
          the hotel became one of the finest hotels in the world, where the
          aristocracy and diplomats would meet, and by the time of her death in
          1930 it was a national institution.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>1965</b> - For some unknown reason (date unknown), Franz Sacher
          Jr., a son of Eduard and his wife Anna, later sold his original recipe
          to Demel's, a fancy coffee cafon the Kohlmarkt, allowing them to
          produce a rival torte. Both the Hotel Sacher and the Demel Patisserie
          claimed to produce the "original" Sachertorte. These two world-famous
          institutions engaged in a lawsuit which lasted for years. The
          judgement in 1965 went in favor of Sacher, giving them the right to
          the "Original Sacher Torte" while Dehmel had to be satisfied with the
          "Original Eduard Sacher Torte". The main difference between the two
          recipes is that in Sacher's case, the layer of jam is between two
          layers of the chocolate sponge, while in Demel's version the jam is on
          top of the sponge but under the chocolate covering.
