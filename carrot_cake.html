        <h2>What about Carrot Cake?</h2>

        <p class="description">
          Cake is a term with a long history, the word is of Viking origin from
          the old Norse - "Kaka". Cake denotes a baked flour confection
          sweetened with sugar and honey; it iscarrot cake mixed with eggs and
          often, but not invariably, with milk and fat and it has a porous
          texture from the mixture rising during cooking. The distinctions
          between bread, bun and biscuit are blurred as techniques for baking
          and leavening developed and eating patterns changed. Some Roman breads
          were enriched with eggs and butter and much have reached a cake-like
          consistency although still named as breads. According to food
          historians, our modern carrot cake most likely descended from Medieval
          carrot puddings enjoyed by people in Europe. No one really knows where
          carrot cake came from, It looks like it did evolve from the Carrot
          Pudding of medieval times, during the middle ages sugar and other
          sweeteners were difficult or expensive to come by in Britain and
          carrots had long been used as sugar substitutes. Carrot Pudding
          history here. Carrot cake and its precursors took several forms
          including baked in pastry, like pumpkin pie steamed and served with
          sauce, like plum pudding baked in pans and served with icing, like
          cake.
