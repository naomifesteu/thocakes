        <h2>What about Pavlova?</h2>

        <p class="description">
          The Oxford English Dictionary may have settled a long-running argument
          between Australia and New Zealand over who invented the pavlova. The
          dessert - meringue with fruit and cream - was named after the Russian
          ballerina Anna Pavlova, who visited both countries in the 1920s.
          Australians and New Zealanders agree on that, but not on who invented
          it. In its relaunched online edition, the OED says the first recorded
          pavlova recipe appeared in New Zealand in 1927. This was in a book
          called Davis Dainty Dishes, published by the Davis Gelatine company,
          and it was a multi-coloured jelly dish. But New Zealanders claim the
          meringue version also originated there, with recipes for it appearing
          in publications in 1928 and 1929. Dr Helen Leach from New Zealand's
          University of Otago is something of a pavlova expert. "I can find at
          least 21 pavlova recipes in New Zealand cookbooks by 1940, which was
          the year the first Australian ones appeared," the author of The
          Pavlova Story told the Daily Telegraph.
